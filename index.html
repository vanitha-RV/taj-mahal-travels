        <p><h2>Is there a sight more iconic, more beautiful, more jaw-droppingly spectacular than the Taj <br>Mahal? </h2> </p>

        <br><br>
        <p>Quite honestly, we can’t think of one.</p><br><br>

        <p>At the very least, there’s no mausoleum more grand, no declaration of love more apparent than building a marble masterpiece for one’s favorite wife… And no better reason to travel than seeing its magnificence up close.</p> <br><br>

        <p>After all, this is art. Built in Agra, <span class="india"><a href="india tour.html">India </a></span> between 1631 and 1648, it’s also history. And, of course, it’s the perfect opportunity to take some otherworldly photos. So, to help visitors prepare for their Taj Mahal travels, we’ve prepared a little guide, enlisting the help of some Intrepid experts – from Destination Managers to acclaimed trip leaders – to cover all the bases.</p><br><br>

        <p>Coming up: what to bring, where to take the best snaps, what else to see in Agra (and beyond), and so much more…</p><br>

<div class="para-2">
        <p>Before you arrive at the Taj Mahal</p> <br><br>

        <p>That old saying ‘patience is a virtue’ really comes into its own when discussing the Taj Mahal.</p><br><br>

        <p>Be prepared to be surrounded by hundreds (if not thousands) of people. These include Indian men, women and children who may ask to take photos with you.</p><br><br>

        <p>To prepare with the help of other travelers and a local tour guide, consider taking a group tour. Intrepid have Taj-visiting trips that range from 8-day Golden Triangle tours (now with solo-only departures!) to 15-day trips dedicated to food, to 19-day trips combining the highlights of India and Nepal.

        </p><br><br>


        <p>If you’re more pressed for time, you can check out the Taj Mahal on a whirlwind day tour from Delhi. Check out Urban Adventures to see the itinerary that we’d recommend for this. And while you’re at it, check out their day trips in <a href="#">Delhi</a>, <a href="#">Jaipur</a>, Varanasi and Mumbai!</p>

    <p>The entrance queue can be pretty long during peak season but as long as you’re mentally prepared, you’ll be fine. What’s to come is more than worth the wait…</p>
    <br><br>
    <p><h1>What to bring to the Taj Mahal</h1></p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Always leave your valuables in the hotel. There are lockers available at the Taj but it’s best to have minimal belongings on you so you don’t spend too much time checking in.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>You really only need to bring the following in one small bag:</p>
    <nav><br><br>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Passport</li><br><br>
            <li>Money</li><br><br>
            <li>Water</li><br><br>
            <li>Medicine</li><br><br>
            <li>Camera</li><br><br>
            <li>Phone</li><br><br>
        </ul>
    </nav>
  <p>What to wear to the Taj Mahal</p>

  <p>There is no dress code but you should still be respectful. If you want to enter the mosque, you will need to cover your head, shoulders and knees.
