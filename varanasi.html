    <p><h2>No book or blog post can prepare you for what to expect or how you might feel in Varanasi. Some places just need to be experienced.</p></h2><br><br><br>

    <p>Located along the banks of the Ganges River, in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, Varanasi is one of the holiest places in all of Hinduism, and one of the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world.</p>

    <p>I spent hours aimlessly wandering around the old city, peering around each and every corner to see what I could find. I would follow my senses, listening to music and chanting make its way through the alleyways, smell my way to lunch, and happily take in all the colourful surroundings.</p>

    <p>Daily life here unfolds at a chaotic pace, and one that’s similar to how it has for centuries. Watch as devout Hindus wash their sins away in the holy Ganges; as men and women bathe and do laundry at the bottom of the Ghats (riverfront steps leading to the bank of the Ganges); and as funeral processions line the streets, where Hindus make their final journey to their final resting place – to be cremated and sent into the Mother Ganges.</p>
